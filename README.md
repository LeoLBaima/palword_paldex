# My First Jetpack Compose Project

This is my first project using Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UI.

## Project Description

This project was created to provide users of the game Palworld with a Paldex, a list of pals to show them. It's my first project using Jetpack Compose, and it's been a great learning experience.

## Architecture

The project follows the MVVM architecture with clean architecture principles. It uses Dagger for dependency injection, RxJava for handling asynchronous tasks and data streams, and Moshi for JSON parsing.

## Technologies Used

- Kotlin: The main programming language used in this project.
- Java: Used in some parts of the project.
- Gradle: The build automation tool used.
- Jetpack Compose: The modern toolkit used for building the native Android UI.
